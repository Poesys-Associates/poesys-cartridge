The files in this Poesys/DB cartridge conf/properties directory are the 
properties files needed to configure testing in the test suite. We need to 
remove these after testing so that the properties files don't interfere with the 
versions in generated systems elsehwere in Eclipse.

To configure unit testing, copy these files into 

cartridges/poesys-db/src/java/com/poesys/db

If you need to modify the copies to target specific databases or change options,
please evaluate whether to save the changes back to the version control
system by copying the file back into this conf/properties directory.
